    "#### Uniform Sequential \n",
    "These types of color maps show really good contrast between the algae and the rest of the image. The best ones are **viridis**, **inferno** and **magma**. The last two show particularly good contrast.\n",
    "#### Sequential\n",
    "While these color maps do single out the algae efficiently, most of them tend to blend the clouds with the rest of the ocean, which may be turn out to be useful later.\n",
    "#### Sequential 2\n",
    "These color maps are similar to those from the Uniform Sequential list, but most of them do not show good contrast between the algae and the rest of the image. **Hot**, **afmhot** and **gist_heat** are good exceptions. **Binary** is also interesting but it's more like the color maps from the Sequential list.\n",
    "#### Diverging\n",
    "These color maps are great for visualizing the difference between negative and positive values, however some of them make it so the algae are sometimes hard to distinguish from the rest of the image. **Coolwarm** is a good exception though. **Bwr** also allows to distinguish clearly the algae when they are hard to see.\n",
    "#### Cyclic\n",
    "While these color maps do highlight the algae, they do not seem adapted to our study either.\n",
    "#### Qualitative\n",
    "These would be an interesting choice. While they do cause a loss of precision (especially for the first ones) by making the scale discrete, this may be useful later.\n",
    "#### Misc\n",
    "While none of these seem very adapted to our study, some have good contrast: **gnuplot2**, **brg**, **jet** and **nipy_spectral**."

    "- As expected, the images are similar to OLCI's but less accurate, with more cloud interference and less algae aggregations detected.\n",
    "- We should try to find dates for which the images are more clear to test out velocity estimation algorithms, but if this is the best we can find, maybe we should look for a way to use these 3 instruments synergistically.\n",
    "- One idea would be to **sync** the images from the satellites to the same time, then superpose them after only leaving the algae (by either using an adapted colormap or using an index threshold) so that way we can have more dense aggregations to track using the algorithms we will write.\n",
    "- Syncing these images however is not an easy thing to do. I don't yet know when the images from OLCI and MODIS are taken **(I should look this up)**. An idea for syncing the images would be to fix a wisely chosen time (that's ideally already synced for two of the satellites) and use drift models to try to estimate the position of the algae at that time.
